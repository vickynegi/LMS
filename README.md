# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby 2.3

* Rails 5.0

* After sign up, just update 'credited_leaves' field in 'user' table from console. In the 'user' table, 'head_id' will contain the head's id for the subordinates. From console, update the 'head_id' of the subordinates' users. Now, 'head' can reject/approve the leaves.
